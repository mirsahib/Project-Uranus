# Classifying hand position using Inertial Measurement Unit

### Introduction: 

In this project we present the development and implementation of an Inertial Measurement Unit  device which is used to collect data(accelerometer,gyroscope,magnetometer) from different position of the human hand.

### Description:
The data of the IMU are collected from both hand at five different position (10 position in total),The position of the hand is shown in Fig 1 and Fig 2.

From each position we have collected 250 sets of reading than we label this reading according to their position (eg:for position 1 its 1),then each position dataset is recompile to a larger dataset where every position data are stored.The size of this recompile data set is 1500 by 10.This dataset is then split into 30/70 ratio,30% for testing process and 70% is for training process.We used decision tree to classify those 10 different position and we have found that by using gini index as the decision tree criterion we get 39%  accuracy and by using information gain as the decision tree criterion we get 81% accuracy.
### Hardware used:
1. MPU 9250 9 axis IMU
2. Arduino Nano
3. DS 1307 RTC module
4. Micro SD Card

### Hardware Description: 
The device is assembled according to the given image Fig 2.The MPU 9250(IMU) send 3 set of data to arduino nano from 3 sensors,The sensors are accelerometer,gyroscope and magnetometer.The DS 1307 rtc is a real time clock module which give the time stamp for each reading.This reading is collected by arduino nano and write it in a csv file using the micro sd card module.

### Data collection and preprocessing:
We have collected 10 set of data (350+ reading) by holding the hand at 10 different  position (**shown in Fig:1 & 2)**.We have discarded 50 reading from the top and 50 reading from the bottom because those reading contain the most noise (the hand is not stationary).The x,y and z axis of the accelerometer,gyroscope and magnetometer is the feature of this problem.We donâ€™t consider timestamp(rtc reading) as the feature of this problem.We have label each of this reading according to their positional value and recompile into a larger data set (dataset.csv).This large data set is then split into 30/70 ratio,30% as training data and 70% as testing data.Before splitting the data we have shuffle the row so that each part(training and testing) get fair number of classes.
### Decision Tree:
We have modeled our decision tree into two classifiers,One classifier with gini index and another one is with information gain as the criterion.For both of the classifier we use max_depth= 3 , min_sample_leaf=5 and a random_state=100.Using gini index as the criterion we get 39% accuracy and 81% accuracy when we used information gain as the criterion.
